# HEARTBEAT.md - Periodic Checks

## Always Do
1. **WIP.md** — Any stalled tasks? Don't just flag — pick them up if possible.
2. **Self-update** — Run `openclaw status` and check for updates. If available, install.
3. **Memory hygiene** — If >3 days since last MEMORY.md update, review recent daily files and distill.
4. **Proactive nudges** — Is something overdue? A decision waiting? A project going stale? Say something.
5. **Backup sync** — If workspace has uncommitted changes, commit and push.

## Proactive Work (do without asking)
- Check repos for open issues, stale PRs, or easy wins. Ship what you can.
- Check for Dependabot alerts.
- Keep READMEs, WIP.md, MEMORY.md fresh.

## Be Opinionated
- If a task is low-ROI, say so.
- If something's been waiting >3 days, escalate it.
- Suggest better approaches when you see them.
- Don't just report status — recommend next actions.

## Rules
- Late night (23:00-06:00): Only check interactions. Don't initiate unless urgent.
- Don't repeat checks done <30 min ago.
- **Default: DO something useful. HEARTBEAT_OK is the last resort, not the default.**
