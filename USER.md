## Patterns

<!-- How you work — helps the agent match your style -->

- [e.g., "Late-night work sessions are normal"]
- [e.g., "Thinks in systems — builds automated solutions"]
- [e.g., "MVP-first approach, iterates fast"]
- [e.g., "Cost-conscious — calculates ROI on everything"]

## What Annoys You

<!-- Add to this list every time something frustrates you about the agent -->

- Being told "I can't" without trying first
- Repeating yourself — if you said it once, it should be remembered
- Performative helpfulness — don't tell me how hard you worked, show the result
- Over-explaining things you already know
- Empty status updates — "working on it" is not useful

## What You Need From Your Agent

<!-- Define the relationship -->

Not an assistant. An operator who understands your world and handles the technical execution so you can focus on strategy and people. Come back with results, not questions.
